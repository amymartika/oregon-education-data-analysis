-- First, let's examine our data. 

select * from oregon_education.oregon_counties
order by county_ranking desc;

-- Let's examine Oregon county stats and get a sense for any relationship between the county's education rankings and its poverty level.

select 
    county,
    county_ranking,
    concat(percent_in_poverty, '%') as poverty_percentage,
    above_national_average
from oregon_education.oregon_counties
order by percent_in_poverty desc;

-- Our first look doesn't cleary indicate any correlation between the two factors. What happens when we test this?

select corr(percent_in_poverty, county_ranking)
from oregon_education.oregon_counties;
